# Keep The Blue Flag Flying High!

A web application that shows my love for the best club in the world: Chelsea F.C.

I created a “Sign in with Google” feature using Oauth2.0. This feature does not really server any purpose (if I'm being completely honest) but it did teach me how to incoporate external authenticaion into my applications. I used the Passport.js framework to achieve this.

Once signed in, users can request to see the all the Chelsea players or a list of Chelsea’s upcoming matches. All the data is pulled from an external API. I used the javascript Axios framework to access the external API.

The backend was developed in JavaScript using Node.js and the Express.Js framework and the frontend was created using React.js.

This application taught me how to work with external APIs, how to deal with authentication (including how to ensure that users cannot access parts of the website before logging in and how to ensure that a user's logged in status persists even after closing their browser) and helped me become more comfortable with using React.js
